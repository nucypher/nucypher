    "This resource focuses on the simplest, highest-level functionality available to developers leveraging *nucypher/nucypher*, NuCypher's access management system (hereafter simply referred to as \"NuCypher\"). Hence, this notebook serves as a technical strategy *beachhead* – an initial foothold for developers to: \n",

    "2) form sensible plans for integrating the NuCypher system\n",

    "### Notes on the data sharing 'narrative'\n",
    "We're going to walk through a typical data sharing journey, or 'narrative', centered around production-ready code snippets. In general terms, this narrative involves a *data controller* who intends for a *designated recipient* to access her data, and so proceeds to connect to the NuCypher network and then create a sharing policy specifically for said recipient. Later, when the recipient requests access to the data, the NuCypher network performs the necessary work for him to gain access. Without spoiling the ending, access is delivered securely, and without further any action required by the data controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate the relationship between the functionality present here and a real-world application leveraging NuCypher, we will occasionally refer to two end-users of a hypothetical health record management platform: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A medical patient (the data controller) \n",
    "- A doctor (the designated recipient) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is nothing special about patients or doctors, other than that the data involved in a medical application is likely to be sensitive. Hence they can be swapped out for any other end-user. These references will mostly appear under the subtitle: \"Relevance to example real-world application\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At various stages of the narrative, we will also dive into important lower-level work occurring in the background, plus abstracted opportunities to customize. Please note that these conceptual explanations will not cover everything, and are simply what we deem to be potentially relevant to a typical application's technical strategy.

For example, in the (highly unlikely) situation where the data recipient successfully colludes with all the Ursulas involved in this sharing narrative, they would only gain access to data kept under that single label in this policy, and nothing else belonging to the data controller, or patient. In this way, labels afford us reliable *forward-secrecy*. In addition, labels are a convenient way to choose specific, per-category sharing parameters for specific data.\n",

    "##### Relevance to example real-world application\n",
    "\n",
    "In our hypothetical real-world application, the granting of a policy is likely to be the first instance in this narrative where the medical patient proactively does something: namely, deciding to add a specific doctor to an approved list for her health records. Note that Alice does not need to encrypt or send the actual data at this moment. In fact, the data doesn't even need to exist yet – for example, not-yet-available results from an medical exam could be shared automatically under this policy (to all the doctors added to it), once they are ready. More on this scenario below, when we introduce *DataSource*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Firstly, the number of Ursulas we requested earlier (n), need to be located. Next, an \"arrangement\" is proposed to those Ursulas, which contains relevant parameters to help each Ursula decide if they want to participate. For example, the arrangement object specifies the funds available to pay for the re-encryption service (known as the \"deposit\" – this can be altered to suit the application's economic requirements) as well as the duration of the policy, which we set earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the required number (n) of Ursulas have accepted the arrangement, an equivalent number of re-encryption key fragments, known as \"KFrags\", are generated. A quick reminder: a *re-encryption key* is a special key unique to NuCypher. It is constructed, safely and locally, using Alice's private key and Bob's public key. Ursulas use re-encryption keys to transform/re-encrypt ciphertexts such that they are decryptable by Bobs – specifically, the Bobs who supplied their public key. So, to get KFrags, the re-encryption key is split into multiple fragments. Each of those stands ready to be sent to the participating Ursulas – one KFrag for each Ursula. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the *.grant()* method also triggers the generation of a \"TreasureMap\" – this returns the locations of all the participating Ursulas, once they have confirmed their involvement. Bob will use the TreasureMap later, when he wants to retrieve the data Alice has shared with him. \n",

    "Imagine a medical scenario where the patient is expecting a regular stream of test results, from a third-party blood-testing lab (i.e. third-party in the sense the lab is not associated with their doctor/hospital), at some point in the future, and wants those results to be immediately shared with the doctors on an existing sharing policy. It would be undesirable to stay online and continually grant access to each test-result as it arrived. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, the application can assign a special role to the blood-testing lab, such that the lab gains the encryption powers of DataSource. Similar to the way 'Alice' represents the patient's device, DataSource can do the same for primary producers of data – in this case, the blood-testing lab. Hence, the lab can write the new data onto the sharing policy, under the specified label. Then, the designated doctors can access it. Thus, DataSource is 'producing' data on the patient's behalf. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this does not mean that DataSource, or the lab, can access other data on the sharing policy - including their own test results, once they've been saved. Accessing the data would require a *read* permission, which has only been granted to Bob – through the existence of a sharing policy, and re-encryption key, in his name. Rather, DataSource(s) have been solely granted a *write* permission to the policy. \n",

How the doctor does this is flexible – the application could automatically retrieve the data as soon as it is suitably encrypted by DataSource, or the doctor could be required to proactively decide when they want their access to begin – the latter may be useful if it's desirable to notify the patient that the doctor has now begun their analysis/diagnosis, and/or how much time the doctor spends looking at the data, for example. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing that needs to be checked is that the number of Ursulas who completed a re-encryption is equal to or greater than the minimum we specified, right at the start (m). We set this to be some fraction of n (the total number of Ursulas involved), to protect against redundancy and ensure that, even if some Ursulas fail to re-encrypt the KFrags they'd received, that the data could reach it's destination. We perform this check using the TreasureMap we generated above, which guides us to the participating Ursulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know that a sufficient number of re-encryptions occurred, it's time to work with the output of that work – \"CFrags\". In the same way a KFrag is a fragment of key, a CFrag is a fragment of ciphertext. When brought together by Bob, these fragments combine into a complete ciphertext, that can be used to access the underlying data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the next step is to gather those CFrags. In order to ensure that the number of collectable CFrags is as expected, the figure is checked against something called a WorkOrder, which was generated previously. It's not worth digging into this, other than to say there is an auditable trail that minimizes unexpected behaviour or DOSs by Ursulas.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step may seem a little odd. We're going to attach the gathered CFrags to an artefact called a 'capsule'. The capsule's role, for the purposes of this narrative, is to bring together the MessageKit (the data we want to share) and the collection of ciphertext fragments, such that Bob can get to the cleartext, and hence the designated recipient is able to access the data they were granted. In reality, the capsule fulfils more than just this, but we can think of the capsule as a way of simply protecting the underlying data, for example in the scenario where Bob does not have the correct CFrags.\n",
