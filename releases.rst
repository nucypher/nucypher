v7.2.0 (2024-01-30)
-------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Make Prometheus exporter always run for Ursula (`#3223 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3223>`__)
-  (`#3224 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3224>`__)
- Add Prometheus metrics endpoint to running logs (`#3231 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3231>`__)
- Add metrics for root and child networks. (`#3339 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3339>`__)
- Make prometheus optional, and allow fine tuning of collection interval. (`#3388 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3388>`__)
- Add prometheus metrics for tracking total threshold decryption requests and errors. (`#3397 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3397>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Don't use web3.py gas strategies, since that switches TX mode to legacy. (`#3368 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3368>`__)
- Node blocks and remains unresponsive when another node in the cohort is
  unreachable during a dkg ritual because the ferveo public key is obtained from
  a node directly through node discovery. Instead, obtain ferveo public key
  from Coordinator contract so that connecting to the another node in
  the cohort is unnecessary. (`#3390 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3390>`__)
- Fix `MAX_UPLOAD_CONTENT_LENGTH` too small for mainnet TACo rituals (`#3396 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/3396>`__)

v6.1.0 (2022-05-10)
-------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- SSL Certificate fetching and Porter optimizations
  - Middleware should try cached SSL certification for a node first, and then if the requests fails, fetch the node's up-to-date SSL cert
  - Short-circuit WorkerPool background execution once sufficient successful executions occur
  - Don't limit WorkerPool size; this has consequences when smaller samples of ursulas are performed; allow threadpool to be flexible by using default min/max

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

v6.0.0 (2022-04-01)
-------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Introduction of NuCypher Porter - a web-based service that performs ``nucypher`` protocol operations on behalf of applications for cross-platform functionality. (`#2664 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2664>`__)
- Ursula no longer stores KFrags, instead Alice encrypts them inside the treasure map.  Allow the KFrag generator and policy publisher to be different entities. (`#2687 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2687>`__)
- Characters use mnemonic seed words to derive deterministic keystore, taking the place of the "keyring". (`#2701 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2701>`__)
- Simplifies the retrieval protocol (see `#259 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/259>`_ for the discussion). ``PolicyMessageKit`` is renamed to ``MessageKit``. ``Bob.retrieve()`` is renamed to ``retrieve_and_decrypt()``, and its signature is simplified: it only requires the treasure map, Alice's verifying key, and the policy encrypting key. A lower-level ``Bob.retrieve()`` is added that does not decrypt, but only attempts to retrieve the capsule frags. (`#2730 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2730>`__)
- Allow importing of secret key material for power derivations. (`#2742 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2742>`__)
- Uniform versioning of bytes serializable protocol entities. (`#2767 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2767>`__)
- Modify Porter REST endpoint from ``/exec_work_order`` to ``/retrieve_cfrags`` and modify request parameters for retrieval of re-encrypted data.
  Update Bob ``/retrieve_and_decrypt`` REST endpoint to accept a list of message kits instead of only one - to match updated ``Bob.retrieve_and_decrypt`` Python API. (`#2768 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2768>`__)
- Update WorkerPool error messages returned by Porter API. (`#2772 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2772>`__)
- Adds ansible build/deploy for Monitor (status.nucypher.network) (`#2801 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2801>`__)
- Extend brand size in ``Versioned`` to 4 bytes (`#2805 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2805>`__)
- CORS, NGINX support for Porter:
  - Added opt-in CORS origins support to Porter; no origins allowed by default when running Porter directly.
  - Provided docker-compose execution for Porter to run behind an NGINX reverse proxy server - all origins allowed by default for CORS, but can be customized. NGINX allows for the potential for more complex infrastructure configurations. (`#2807 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2807>`__)
-  (`#2809 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2809>`__)

- - nucypher cloudworkers now contains a complete and comprehensive set of features for easily managing, backing up and restoring one to many workers (`#2365 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2365>`__)
- New composite gas strategy that uses the median from three different gas price oracles

-------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added support for a user-provided gas price to the ``nucypher stake`` command, using ``--gas-price GWEI``. (`#2425 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2425>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Correct CLI problems when setting the min fee rate. Also, simplifies usage by expressing rates in GWEI. (`#2390 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2390>`__)
- Tone-down learning logging messages even more (see issue #1712). Fixes some CLI and exception messages. (`#2395 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2395>`__)
- Fixes logical bug in ``WorkTracker`` to ensure commitment transactions can only be issued once per period. (`#2406 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2406>`__)

- Now ``BlockchainInterface.gas_strategy`` always has a value; previously it was possible to pass ``None`` via the constructor (e.g. if the config file had an explicit ``"null"`` value). (`#2421 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2421>`__)
- Take advantage of the changes in PR#2410 by retrying worker commitments on failure (`#2422 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2422>`__)
- Domain "leakage", or nodes saving metadata about nodes from other domains (but never being able to verify them) was still possible because domain-checking only occurred in the high-level APIs (and not, for example, when checking metadata POSTed to the node_metadata_exchange endpoint).  This fixes that (fixes #2417).

  Additionally, domains are no longer separated into "serving" or "learning".  Each Learner instance now has exactly one domain, and it is called domain. (`#2423 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2423>`__)

- Fixes to status page based on reworked design done in PR #2351. (`#2378 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2378>`__)
- Track pending Ursula commitment transactions due to slower gas strategies. (`#2389 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2389>`__)

-------------------

Misc
~~~~

- Set default teacher uri for mainnet. (`#2367 <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/2382>`__)
