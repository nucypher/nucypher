"""
Node Discovery happens in phases.  The first step is for a network actor to learn about the mere existence of a Node.
This is a straightforward step which we currently do with our own logic, but which may someday be replaced by something
like libp2p, depending on the course of development of those sorts of tools.  The introduction of hamming distance
in particular is useful when wanting to learn about a small number (~500) of nodes among a much larger (25,000+) swarm.
This toolchain is not built for that scenario at this time, although it is not a stated nongoal.

After this, our "Learning Loop" does four other things in sequence which are not part of the offering of node discovery tooling alone:

* Instantiation of an actual Node object (currently, an Ursula object) from node metadata.  TODO
* Validation of the node's metadata (non-interactive; shows that the Node's public material is indeed signed by the wallet holder of its Staker).
* Verification of the Node itself (interactive; shows that the REST server operating at the Node's interface matches the node's metadata).
* Verification of the Stake (reads the blockchain; shows that the Node is sponsored by a Staker with sufficient Stake to support a Policy).

These tests show that each phase of this process is done correctly, and in some cases, with attention to specific
performance bottlenecks.
