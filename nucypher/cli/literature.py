-------------------------------

By agreeing to stake {tokens} ({nunits} NuNits):

- Staked tokens will be locked for the stake duration.

- You are obligated to maintain a networked and available Ursula-Worker node
  bonded to the staker address {staker_address} for the duration
  of the stake(s) ({lock_periods} periods).

- Agree to allow NuCypher network users to carry out uninterrupted re-encryption

Failure to keep your node online or fulfill re-encryption work orders will result
in loss of staked NU as described in the NuCypher slashing protocol:
https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/slashing.html.

Keeping your Ursula node online during the staking period and successfully
producing correct re-encryption work orders will result in rewards
