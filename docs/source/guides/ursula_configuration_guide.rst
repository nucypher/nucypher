Ursula Configuration Guide
==========================

1. Install NuCypher and geth
------------------------------

If you want to run a NuCypher node that participates in the decentralized network,
you need to install it first. The installation procedure for the Ursula (Worker)
node is exactly the same as for Staker.

First, you install geth. You'll need to run it in the background and sync up.
For testnet, it is:

.. code:: bash

    $ geth --goerli --no-usb

You need to create a software-controlled account in geth:

.. code:: bash

    $ geth attach ~/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc
    > personal.newAccount();
    > eth.accounts[0]
    ["0xc080708026a3a280894365efd51bb64521c45147"]

So, your worker account is ``0xc080708026a3a280894365efd51bb64521c45147`` in
this case.

Before installing ``nucypher``, you may need to install necessary developer
tools and headers, if you don't have them already. In Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint
or similar distros, that is:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip

Install ``nucypher`` either by doing ``sudo pip3 install nucypher`` if you have
a dedicated instance or container, or with a ``virtualenv``:

.. code:: bash

    $ virtualenv -p python3 nucypher
    $ source nucypher/bin/activate
    (nu)$ pip3 install nucypher

Before continuing, verify that your ``nucypher`` installation and entry points are functional:

Activate your virtual environment (if you haven't already) and run the ``nucypher --help`` command

.. code:: bash

    $ source nucypher/bin/activate
    ...
    (nucypher)$ nucypher --help


You will see a list of possible usage options (``--version``, ``-v``, ``--dev``, etc.) and commands (``status``, ``ursula``).
For example, you can use ``nucypher ursula destroy`` to delete all files associated with the node.

If your installation is non-functional, be sure you have the latest version installed, and see the `Installation Guide`_

.. _Installation Guide: installation_guide.html



2. Configure a new Ursula node
--------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher ursula init --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa --staker-address <YOUR STAKER ADDRESS>


Replace ``<YOUR PROVIDER URI>`` with a valid node web3 node provider string, for example:

    - ``ipc:///home/ubuntu/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc`` - Geth Node on Görli testnet running under user ``ubuntu`` (most probably that's what you need).
    - ``ipc:///tmp/geth.ipc``   - Geth Development Node
    - ``http://localhost:7545`` - Ganache TestRPC (HTTP-JSON-RPC)
    - ``ws://0.0.0.0:8080``     - Websocket Provider

``<YOUR STAKER ADDRESS>`` is the address you've staked from when following the
:ref:`staking-guide`.


3. Enter or confirm your public-facing IPv4 address when prompted
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    Enter Nodes Public IPv4 Address: <YOUR NODE IP HERE>


4. Create a password when prompted
-----------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    Enter a password to encrypt your keyring: <YOUR PASSWORD HERE>


.. important::::
    Save your password as you will need it to relaunch the node, and please note:

    - Minimum password length is 16 characters
    - Do not use a password that you use anywhere else

5. Connect to a Fleet
------------------------

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher ursula run --teacher <SEEDNODE_URI> --interactive

The teacher ``SEEDNODE_URI`` is given in a form ``ip_address:port``, for example
``13.48.124.134:9151``.


6. Verify Ursula Blockchain Connection (Interactive)
------------------------------------------------------

This will drop your terminal session into the “Ursula Interactive Console” indicated by the ``>>>``.
Verify that the node setup was successful by running the ``status`` command.

.. code:: bash

    Ursula >>> status


7. To view a list of known Ursulas, execute the ``known_nodes`` command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    Ursula >>> known_nodes


You can also view your node’s network status webpage by navigating your web browser to ``https://<your-node-ip-address>:9151/status``.

.. NOTE::
    Since Ursulas self-sign TLS certificates, you may receive a warning from your web browser.


8. To stop your node from the interactive console and return to the terminal session:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    Ursula >>> stop


9. Subsequent node restarts do not need the teacher endpoint specified:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher ursula run --poa
