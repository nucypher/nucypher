# NuCypher releases and notes

``# v0.1.0-alpha.0 Release Notes (Genesis Release)
 
***1*** In the beginning cryptography created the ciphertext and the plaintext.
***2*** And the ciphertext was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the secret (symmetric) key. And then the spirit of asymmetric crypto moved upon the face of the interwebs.
***3*** And cryptographers said, Let there be encapsulation: and there was encapsulation.
***4*** And they saw* the light, that it was good: and divided* the symmetric ciphertext from the encapsulated key.
***5*** And they called the symmetric ciphertext "bulk data", and the encapsulated key the "*Capsule*". And the encryption and the decryption were the first secure message.
***6*** And they said, Let there be a re-encryption node in the midst of the interwebs, and let it divide the Bobs from the Bobs.
***7*** And they made the re-encryption protocol, and divided the *Bobs* which were authorized under the *Policy* from the *Bobs* which were not authorized: and it was so.
***8*** And they called the re-encryption nodes *Ursula*. And the re-encryption and the decryption were the second secure message.
***9*** And they said, Let the ciphertext fragments under the interwebs be gathered together unto one place, and let the Capsule appear: and it was so.
***10*** And they called the total number of framents **`n`**, and the number that Bob needed to reassamble **`m`**: and they saw that it was good.
***11*** And they said, Let the interwebs bring forth a Character, *Alice*, who yields the *Policy*, and a Character, *Enrico*, who yields the encrypted message after his kind, whose symmetric key is in itself, and let the Ursulas that are participating in the *Policy* be listed in a *TreasureMap*, upon the interwebs: and it was so.
***12*** And the earth brought forth *Alice*, and *Enrico*, and *Ursula*, and *Bob*: and the decentralized dapp developer community saw that it was good.
***13*** And the complete access management flow was the third secure message.
***14*** And they said, Let there be a coherent metaphor and API in the  of cryptology of the interwebs, and let Policies expire at a specific datetime or upon revocation, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
***15*** And let them be for decentralized re-encryption tooling in the cryptography of the interwebs to give privacy upon the blockchain: and it was so.
